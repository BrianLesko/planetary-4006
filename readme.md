# Planetary Gearbox for 4006 series brushless motor

**My go-to board for servo motor and ESC control** 
This weekend, I brushed up on my CAD skills and designed a compact planetary gearbox for 4006 series brushless DC motors. The entire assembly, including the motor, stands at just 4cm tall and delivers an 8:1 gearing ratio for higher torque and finer position control.

## Why such a tiny gearbox

Sure, you ***could*** make a larger gearbox, but why? This one is only 4cm tall.

The 3d model files were made with [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) and exported to stl files for printing.

## 3d Printed Mount 

The print needs high accuracy because this setup is so compact. Its smaller than most 3d printers can make.
